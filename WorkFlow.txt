I will articulate my thought process in this file for the project.

1.H1 tag will say, "Your all in one Task manager".
2. H3 tag - "Add the number of tasks you have throughout the day."
Add a date counter to mention the date, which will tell the user which day it is.

Main part :- Add a counter which will show the numbers which will have numbers with them and two buttons with option to increase or decrease.
-- Another button for submission.

Redirect to the next page which will have a number of text field equal to the number submitted before.
This page will also have an option which will have 3 options to determine the importance of the task.
It will be categorized(tags) into 3 types on the basis of their importance:
1. Less important (Yellow)
2. Important (Green)
3. Most Important (Red)
This page will also have a submit button.


Last Page: 
- The Last page will have all the items which were added as tasks on the list. 
- On top of that, there will be 2 checkboxes which will have the options, complete and not complete.
